# Pirika
> Where Music Meets Magic ✨
###### By Miguel Ángel Platero Duque

*Pirika* is a music streaming service that lets you listen to any song from our catalog, along or with friends, as you wish!

We believe in the idea that music is magical, and that songs can transport you to a new reality, just as spells do...
